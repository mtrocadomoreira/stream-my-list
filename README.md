# Stream My List

**Find your TMDB watchlist movies across streaming services instantly.**

A client-side web application that helps you discover which movies from your TMDB watchlist are available on your streaming services, across multiple countries.

üîó **[Live Demo](https://stream-my-list.netlify.app/)** (coming soon)

### APIs & Data

- **[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)** - Movie data, ratings, posters, and authentication
- **[JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/)** - Streaming availability data (via TMDB)

### Development

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è and üåÄ (hyperfocus) by [Mariana Moreira](https://github.com/mtrocadomoreira)

This app was developed **with the assistance of an LLM coding assistant** (Claude by Anthropic).

## Notes about the development

This project was made for learning (and hyperfocus) purposes. This section is for anyone who is interested in the implementation.

### Architecture

This is a **pure client-side application** with no backend server. All the magic happens in your browser using:

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, just clean ES6+
- **TMDB API v3** - Movie data and streaming availability
- **JustWatch Integration** - Streaming provider information (via TMDB)
- **localStorage** - Session persistence and caching

### Data Flow

```
1. User logs in via TMDB OAuth
   ‚Üì
2. Selects countries & streaming services
   ‚Üì
3. App fetches watchlist from TMDB API
   ‚Üì
4. For each movie (in batches of 15):
   - Fetches streaming availability
   - Checks cache first (24h TTL)
   - Filters by selected countries/services
   ‚Üì
5. Results displayed progressively
   ‚Üì
6. User can filter, sort, and click through to TMDB/streaming links
```

### API Usage

The app makes efficient use of the TMDB API:

- **Rate Limiting**: Max 40 requests/second (configurable)
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Watchlist: 1 hour TTL
  - Streaming data: 24 hours TTL
  - Genres: 7 days TTL
- **Batch Processing**: Processes movies in groups to balance speed and API limits

### Security & Privacy

- **API Key Visibility**: The TMDB API key is visible in the source code. This is intentional for a client-side app and identifies the application (not individual users).
- **User Authentication**: Handled securely via TMDB's OAuth session flow.
- **No Data Collection**: Your watchlist data stays in your browser. Nothing is sent to any third-party servers.
- **Session Storage**: Optional "Remember Me" stores session locally. You can disable this anytime.

### Code Highlights

#### Caching System
```javascript
// 3-tier caching with TTLs
cache: {
  watchlist: null,           // 1 hour
  streamingData: {},         // 24 hours
  genres: null               // 7 days
}
```

#### Progressive Loading
```javascript
// Batch processing with live UI updates
const BATCH_SIZE = 15;
for (let i = 0; i < movies.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
  const batch = movies.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
  // Process batch...
  this.renderMovies(); // Update UI immediately
}
```

#### Configuration Change Detection
```javascript
// Auto-refresh when user changes settings
hasConfigurationChanged() {
  const countriesChanged = /* compare arrays */;
  const servicesChanged = /* compare arrays */;
  return countriesChanged || servicesChanged;
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why does the search take so long?**
A: The app needs to fetch streaming data for every movie in your watchlist. Longer watchlists take longer ‚òπÔ∏è

**Q: Can I use this without a TMDB account?**
A: No, you need a TMDB account to access your watchlist. It's free to sign up!

**Q: Does this work with Netflix/Hulu/etc.?**
A: Yes! The app shows availability across all streaming services that TMDB/JustWatch tracks.
